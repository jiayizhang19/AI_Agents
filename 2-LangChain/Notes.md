## Foundational Models
- temperature: control the randomness of the model's output.
a higher number makes the responses more creative, a lower one makes them more deterministic.
- max token: limits the total number of tokens in the response, controlling how long the output can be.
- timeout: the max time to wait for a response from the model before cancelling their request
- max retries: the max amount of times to retry a request if that request fails.
